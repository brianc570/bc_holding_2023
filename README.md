Holding Of Productivity Data Analysis 
Here is a "dummy" version of an actual spreadsheet that automatically calculates productivity pulled from a SQL database. This is not real data - but mock data. It's 99% self-automated, the only thing that needs to be tended to are the internal lookup tables. This was built to reduce time on manually building reports & improve accuracy.

Previously, it would take about a week to complete (chunks of time each day). The tabs calculate just like a pivot table and a dashboard was added for data visualization.

Since this is dummy data, it doesn't give the actual spreadsheet justice.  Names and company names have been abbreviated. In reality, the actual spreadsheet has employee names and over 10 lines of business that need to be monitored. These were built to give accurate feedback and ease of reporting for the supervisors.

The spreadsheet has to "normalize" two datasets ADP hours and SQL database, which rely on helper columns to adjust the names (i.e. Co. 1 Co. B 1 Co. C 1 = Co. 1, and ADP data has to translate to the SQL database.). The ADP data that was normalized and fixed was normalized in separate spreadsheet.
